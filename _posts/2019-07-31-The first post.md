# 前言
> This blog is mainly used for sharing experiences. 

Tow parts were included in this bolg, I will write down some experiences about coding what I learned form work, just a few tips.

The other part is about my learning process in sound design if I could keep it record


## Code

xcodebuild 的使用可以用 `man xcodebuild`查看。

我只介绍关键的用法

查看项目详情

	xcodebuild -list

## Sound
首先需要创建一个`AdHocExportOptions.plist`文件

添加两个Key-Value

- merhod : ad-hoc
- compileBitcode : NO

或者直接复制
