# Introduction

Last month I got the certification of Wwise101, sharing my experienxes here helps me make record.


#### Info

This test is not diffcicult, to be honest, I am not sure if this certification widely recognized. Wwise 101 seems like a very basic one test, if you wanna past this exam, just learn the tutorial on the Wwise website, that is enough.<br>
This site is: <https://www.audiokinetic.com/zh/products/wwise/>

#### Tutorial

Basic operations of this software are all in the first tutorial. There are 7 classes, which are all focus on how to use this sofeware to make sound more realiable, we have to understand the rules and try to make the game diversity.<br>
I think the third class is a little difficult, because it uses two concepts to discribe game sound and we need to use different ways to generate the sound for different situations.<br>
Excepts for these, it is easy to understand.


#### Test

You need to buy the test on the site, it may cost you about $200, you only have 2 chance to pass the test, 
if you failed twice, sorry you have to buy the test again.<br>
It is all about choice questiones, only few fill-ins. After every tutorial, you will have an exercise of what you learn , 
and parts of the topic will be in the test finally.
But if you want to past the test, you have to keep the logic of operations in mind, because there are some topics in 
the test you would not see in the exercises. There are not questiones bank on the internet, so you may try the test for real.
