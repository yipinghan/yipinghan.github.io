2015/09-2017/05 Acousic lab   measurement for line arrays
Description: measure the sound field in near-field and far-field, discussed the relation between results and performance. 
Responsibility:1.measure the directivity, freq-response, cover angle in near-field for line arrary loudspeaker's performance. 
2.propose the measurement methods for line array in near-field and evaluate the methods. 
According to the reasearch result we found the rules in acoustics radiation and try to estimate the radiation in far-field.
