为什么选择英格兰，为什么选择这个学校，为什么选择这个项目

For my first master's degree, based on my engineering background I chose audio technology as my major. During this period, I made many attempts to increase my understanding of the audio field. For example, I worked as an audio technologist in the recording of the famous show “Voice of China”. Also, as a trainer, I taught the basics of acoustics and trained the hearing of lab researchers. Gradually, I grew particularly interested in psychoacoustics and sound design, particularly the kind of sound which could be attractive and how technology could generate it. Eventually, learning sound design became my inner passion.

After graduating from CUC with excellent results, I became an audio engineer. The skills I learned helped me to deepen my understanding of relevant working practices. However, I found although I can use various scientific methods to reduce noise, make voices sound crisper and cleaner, I could not design complimenting sounds for products based on the enterprise’s characteristics. I suppose that is why my work responsibilities still remain ensuring the sound quality is acceptable to users, rather than providing better sound performance for users.

Over time, I have been thinking hard about pursuing another Master’s degree in sound design. Knowledge of sound design is pivotal for me to answer the lingering doubts of art using practical technology. Especially as the end target is the pursuit of an abstract art form. In comparing curriculums of different schools, I find that most other curriculums are aimed at film or TV production. By contrast, your school’s course is aimed towards thinking about sound’s role in a wider creative arts environment, and it provides advanced skills for whichever media context I wish to specialize in. I believe this project will augment my growth because its values are congruous with my goals. 

I am keenly aware that pursuing further study through a scholarship would provide benefits in many ways. But most important is the positive support, which will help supplement my confidence in the viability of my career goal. Sound-related work is not as popular as work as software engineers. It is easy to compromise and bow to the life pressures. I have also experienced struggles, disappointment, and self-doubt. I believe this scholarship is a needed show of a support to artists - just like Andrew Grant gave his support to young artists, encouraging us to have confidence in future, which is our greatest desire as people who want to engage in the art industry.

In this rare one-year learning opportunity, I intend to set up a personal channel on the Internet, sharing my experiences about learning to let more people get to know about sound design and your school. I hope that would have valuable reference for upcoming sound designers’ choices, because I have been personally influenced by alumni from your school. 

In general, I know that the ECA community can offer me the opportunity to achieve this goal. I hope that my application for this scholarship will be successful.




首先我选择这个项目，是基于职业发展上的考虑，希望能在目前所有的基础上有新的突破和交叉式的工作发展 这份项目所能提供的内容在音频设计领域来说是非常重要的。我是一个音频工程师，我非常希望能够为自己的发展添加艺术的部分，我相信当我有这样的学习经历在职场上，一定能够解决更多的问题，不论是艺术上还是技术上，这都为这个项目进行了无声的宣传。 如果成为scholars，可以遇见得到，一定会有很多宣传方面的工作，我非常高兴和乐意做这样的事，这不仅是我的专长，也是我的兴趣所在，音视频媒体的传播已经是目前全球最主要的宣传方式之一，而我作为音频工程师或者说是声音设计师，我希望能用我的技能，为宣传提供更多的可能性，而且有更多人能够通过我们的宣传知道和了解苏格兰，知道我们这个项目，能够也励志加入，为更多的需要帮助的人传递信息，帮助他人实现目标。我相信我会在international network中遇到来自各国优秀的各行各业从业者，这样的火花碰撞机会实属难得，相信每一个人都很渴望，能够以多个角度看待世界，相信这是一种全新的成长方式。

First of all, I choose this project based on the consideration of career development, hoping to make new breakthroughs and cross job development based on the current situation. The content provided by this project is very important in the field of audio design. As an audio engineer, I am eager to add art to my own development. I believe that when I have such learning experience in the workplace, I will surely be able to solve more problems, no matter in art or technology, which will provide silent publicity for this project. If become scholars, can be met, there will be a lot of propaganda work, I am very glad and happy to do such a thing, this is not only my specialty, is also my interest, the transmission of audio and video media is currently one of the world's main propaganda way, and my voice as an audio engineer or designer, I hope I can use my skills, to provide more possibilities for propaganda, and there are more people to know and understand Scotland, through our propaganda know this project, we can also inspiring to join, to transfer information more and more people in need, helping others achieve their goals. I believe that In the International network, I will meet outstanding practitioners from all walks of life from different countries. Such a rare opportunity for sparks. I believe that everyone is eager to see the world from multiple perspectives and this is a brand new way of growth.


你在交流（书写和表达上）有什么经验或者技能，和别一起工作有什么技能或者经验 和别人一起工作时我是很出色的协助角色，我擅长在主力中坚力量完成之后锦上添花，各种没有注意到的细节或者需要展示需要交流的部分，我都可以出色的完成，让整个工作有更好的成果。Presatation 有很多种，大型场所或者小型会议，无论是什么场合，我知道首先要逻辑清晰，条理有序，这也是我作为工程师的最基本的职业素养，否则很容易让人困惑。其次要保持良好的耐心的态度，这也是我在工作几年之后学习到的经验，不论面对的观众是什么角色，有什么样的反应，能保证稳定的情绪和认真礼貌是很必要的。在presatation的过程中，音频和图像的结合是常用的手段之一，我擅长使用音频作为展示，这不仅可以提高人们的注意力，还能为展示留下深刻的回忆。

In communication (writing and speaking) you have any experience or skills, and don't have any skills or experience in working with others I am a very good assist role at work, I'm good at the icing on the cake, after completion of the main backbone of various did not notice the details or need show part of the communication, I can finish, make the whole work have better results. There are many kinds of Presatation, such as large venues or small meetings. No matter what the occasion is, I know that the first thing is to be logical and organized, which is also my basic professional quality as an engineer, otherwise it is easy to get confused. Secondly, it is necessary to maintain a good attitude of patience, which is also the experience I have learned after working for several years. No matter what role the audience is playing and what kind of reaction they have, it is necessary to ensure stable mood, seriousness and politeness. In the process of presatation, the combination of audio and images is one of the commonly used methods. I am good at using audio as presentation, which can not only improve people's attention, but also leave deep memories for presentation.
