1. Introduction
There is very little general documentation about the sound field measurement of the line-array loudspeaker system, mainly because of its large size, which is extremely difficult to measure, and it often needs a long distance. Now the public detailed measurement results and analysis have been given by JBL Company, using ground measurement method to get frequency response according to discrete angles and specific orientation of arrays which including two-loudspeaker arrays, four-loudspeaker arrays and nine-loudspeaker arrays. 
The measurement results show that with the increase of array size, the sets of lobes increases, sound pressure levels at lobes decreases, the directivity of arrays increases predominantly at higher frequencies, also the degree of signal interference effects is much serious [1]. After that, JBL also published the measurement method for VT4889 line-array loudspeaker system [2]: they use the ground measurement method with the MLSSA analyzer to measure and predict the directivity and coverage angles when line arrays at various cabinet-to-cabinet splay angles. In addition, Meyer Sound Company use …. Method to measure the horizontal and vertical directivity in different box splay angles of curved arrays. The results show that the directivity will not be clearly evident when the wavelength is close to the array size [3]. By analyzing the performance data of the line-array loudspeaker system, there are some common problems: (1) the arrays’ parameters published by the manufacturers are all about unit-box; (2) the coverage angles and frequency response differ most, which provided by different manufacturers in different forms. Besides, the coverage angles does not indicate the frequency information; (3) most parameters provided are produced by software simulation. In this paper, the near-field characteristics of line-array loudspeaker system are measured in a large anechoic room. In general, the typical use area of line-array loudspeaker system actually starts from the front about 30 m, and the “near-field” in this paper is within that area.

2. Measurement method
2.1 Measurement of unit-box
The measured line-array loudspeaker system is a domestic brand product which consists of 8 unit boxes. Considering that the frequency response and directivity of each unit box should not differ greatly, it is necessary to measure the directivity of the unit box before arraying, and the measurement location should be selected in a large anechoic room. The room is 16.00 m long, 7.15 m wide and 6.60 m high. The anechoic chamber environment is shown in Figure 1.

CLIO electro-acoustic measurement system was used with MLS pseudorandom sequences signals. The box was placed on the turntable. The measurement microphone is 1 m away from the acoustical centre of the sound source in the horizontal direction, and the height of it is consistent with the centre height of the measured box. MLS pseudorandom sequences signals are set up by CLIO and played by the array loudspeaker system. Angular increments were taken every 3° from 0° to 360°. Horizontal and vertical directivity were measured respectively. 

Response data gathered in the region from 250 Hz to 16000 Hz and eight groups of directivity are shown in polar form. The horizontal and vertical directivity graphs of one unit box were shown in figure 2 and figure 3 respectively.

2.2 Measurement of Array loudspeaker system

8-box array splayed at 0° and placed vertically on the side of the anechoic room. The array loudspeaker system was measured in sweep way in the vertical direction. The measurement area was 12 m long and 6 m wide in front of the system and measurement points were set every 0.25 m, totalling 1,225 measurement points. The measurement microphone is placed right above the measurement point, keeping the height consistent with the centre height of unit box. The measurement system arrangement is shown in Figure 4.

The sound measurement analyzer should be calibrated before measurement, and the pink-noise signal was played by the line-array loudspeaker system. Record LZeq(Equivalent Continuous Sound Level Z-weighting) data from 125Hz to 20kHz which lasted 10 s. Repeat this step iterating over all measurement points. The gains of all hardware need to be fixed in this whole measurement

3. Data and analysis
3.1 Sound field distribution in the near-field

The same SPL(sound pressure level) was shown by the same colour. It is clear that the directivity became more evident with the frequency increasing. The closer the array is, the more complex the SPL distribution is and interlace is obvious. The power is much concentrated at low-frequency, and the cylindrical character is obvious at mid-frequency and high-frequency. Above 5,000 Hz, SPL drops rapidly and discontinuously. Lobes appear on both sides of the distribution map, which are asymmetric. At high-frequency, the energy decreases quickly, and the directivity is not concentrated because of the side lobes. Figure. 5 shows sound field distribution of line array with different frequency from 250 Hz to 16 000 Hz in the near-field.

3.2 Directivity in the near-field
The directivity measurement results of unit box show that the difference is not large. If the variance of difference is less than 3 dB, the vertical directivity of the line array can be measured. Circle with centre at sound source centre of the array system and radius equal to 3 m, the vertical directivity was measured in the front semicircle region of the array. The measurement was taken on 3° intervals from 0° to 180°. Then normalize the data and draw polar responses. The polar responses are only limited to the near-field. The polar charts from 250 Hz to 16 kHz are shown in figure 6:

250 Hz 500 Hz 1 000 Hz 2 000 Hz
4 000 Hz 8 000 Hz 16 000 Hz

Figure 6 vertical directivity of line-array speaker system (8-box)

With the increase of frequency, the vertical directivity of the line-array system is clearly evident. The central lobe is not predominant because of the number and size of side lobes. The sharpness of the array directivity is not as significant as the unit box’s one. 

3.3 quarter-power angle 

The quarter-power angle (coverage angle) refers to the angle between the directions of the SPL 6 dB lower than the loudest SPL direction on both sides of the central lobe, which can be derived from the directivity measurement results. The measurement results of coverage angles in the horizontal and vertical directions of unit box are shown in table 1. 

Table 1 horizontal/vertical coverage angles of the unit box

The vertical coverage angle of the unit box has a decreasing trend from low-frequency to high-frequency, but slightly increasing at 16 kHz. The horizontal coverage angle is only about 40° in the mid-frequency. The quarter-power angle measurement results were shown in table 2. 
Table 2 quarter-power angle of line array system

The theoretical value of quarter-power angle of the line-array, found by the formula [5], where f is the frequency and L is the length of the line-array. If the frequency is doubled, the quarter-power angle will be reduced by half. That is based on the ideal mathematical model in the far-field conditions.  However, the quarter-power angles in this paper were measured in the near-field which derived from the vertical directivity of line-array. The polar charts of array show the directivity at high-frequency is more acute than at low-frequency, however, the curve flattens when SPL falling 6dB which makes the coverage angle wide. The measured array’s quarter-power angle is unstable with frequency. The results would be different if splay angles change.

3.4 On-axis SPL of the line-array speaker system in the near-field
On-axis responses show that SPL decreased for increasing distance with slight fluctuations. The attenuation SPL data were fitted in logarithmic scale, the fitted curves are shown in Figure 7 which x-axis presents distance (measurement points), and y-axis presents SPL.

125 Hz to 250 Hz

500 Hz 1 000 Hz

2 000 Hz 4 000 Hz

8,000 Hz, 16,000 Hz
Figure 7 fitted curves of on-axis SPL for line array loudspeaker system (8-box)

The fitting result of low frequency is good. Within the measurement area, the falling trend is apparent and smooth. The higher the frequency, the more serious the fluctuation of data. There are spherical and cylindrical radiation exists in certain region in the radiation effects of line-array loudspeaker system. The endpoint of near-field was found by: [7]. It is only an approximate distance. In the near-field, SPL decreased at 3dB per doubling of distance and 6dB in the far-field. However, Figure 7 suggests that SPL did not drop in 3dB way.  Besides, SPL attenuation is not monotonous because of interference. With increasing distance, the SPL curve would have a stable decline trend in the farther field. The fitted results could probably provide predict calculation of SPL value in the far-field. 


4. Conclusion
This paper measure the sound field characteristics of the line-array loudspeaker system in a large anechoic room. The sound field distribution map, directivity and quarter-power angle are measured and analyzed. These acoustic parameters’ results can be used as references for the performance evaluation of line-array loudspeaker system. Based on the on-axis SPL data, fitted curves show the trend and rules of SPL attenuation in the near-field.
